// Lightweight, no-new-dependency spam defenses for the public demo form —
// this endpoint has no auth/CSRF (it's a public lead form), so anything
// scriptable can POST directly to it. Real spam observed (Aug 2026):
// gibberish names/companies, valid-format-but-fake emails, correct enum
// values for businessType/referralSource — a scripted bot, not a human.
//
// Two independent, free signals. Either one alone is enough to treat a
// submission as spam. If this isn't sufficient against more sophisticated
// bots (ones that skip the honeypot and pace their requests), the real next
// step is a managed challenge like Cloudflare Turnstile — that needs a new
// account/site key, deliberately not reached for here first.
